I'm a Canadian computer programmer working in the K-W area. This blog is mostly for software-related stuff, although the occasional other post may appear. 

### Contact me

Bug reports and feature requests for my software are best submitted as Github issues or pull requests.

I'm very bad at responding to email, but you can generally find me on the Freenode (try #git or #clojure) or Nightstar (try #code) IRC networks. Or, if you're on ifMUD, check the lounge.
