title: Emufun no longer under active development
---

The thing I originally wrote it for (easily launching emulators via a controller) is no longer something we need, and the thing we ended up using it for in practice (watching videos) is now better served by Kodi (formerly XBMC).

I'm leaving it up on github for the interested, but it's no longer seeing use and thus, no longer getting updated.
