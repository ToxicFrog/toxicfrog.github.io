title: ifIRC 0.1.0 released
---

[ifIRC](https://github.com/ToxicFrog/ifirc), the ifMUD <-> IRC proxy, has now been officially released, after a bunch of restructuring to improve reliability and remove the dependence on the Saturnine library. I've been using it locally for about a year, but haven't considered it ready for general use until now.

The github page has the details, but in short, this is a daemon that lets you connect to ifMUD using an IRC client rather than Telnet or a MUD client. (If you don't already know what ifMUD is, this tool is probably not interesting to you.)
