title: Searchable maps for System Shock
---

To celebrate the [SS1 20th Anniversary Devstream](http://twitch.tv/algorithmancy/) -- and because I've been meaning to do this for a while -- the System Shock maps I've been generating are now searchable by object name. You can search just the current level, or (if using the "all levels" map file) the entire game. The search will show both the location of the objects themselves, and the location of any containers that they're in.

The maps are available [on funkyhorror](http://funkyhorror.ancilla.ca/toxicfrog/ss1/maps/), and the tool that generates them [on github](https://github.com/toxicfrog/ss1edit).
