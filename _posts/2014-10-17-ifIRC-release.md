title: ifIRC 0.2.0 released
---

[ifIRC](https://github.com/ToxicFrog/ifirc) 0.2.0 features a complete rewrite of command line handling using tools.cli 0.3.1. It now has sensible defaults for various command line flags and doesn't use the positional arguments.

It also has three new features, `--autoexec` for automatically executing a command on connect and `--autojoin` and `--autochan` to more closely link IRC and MUD channel management. See the README for details.
