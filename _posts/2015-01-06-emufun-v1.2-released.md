title: Emufun v1.2 released!
---

The release is available, as usual, via [Github](https://github.com/ToxicFrog/EmuFun/releases/tag/v1.2). There's only one significant change in this release, but it's a big one: file metadata and directory listings are now stored in per-directory .emufun.cache files rather than a central per-user file.

This has a bunch of ramifications: directory scans are now much faster for unchanged directories; watched/unwatched state is preserved across users and OSes; and you can move or copy a directory without throwing away all of the emufun metadata.
